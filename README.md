Facelift

Using a popular CSS framework 'bootstrap' to design the page. Start by initialsing bootstap (same as other flask extensions in init.py)
include bootstrap to base.html so that it is inherited to all pages
wtf.quick_form() renders the complete form, includes support for display validation errors, and all styled as appropriate for the Bootstrap framework (resgister.py).

Dates and times
install and initialise flask-moment init.py
flask moment works with moment.js 
moment object provides different time formatting in this case using 'LLL' to display the active times in user.html
same concept for post to show when something is posted
