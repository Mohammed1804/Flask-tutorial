1) added a route componant (routes.py) that allows the user to invoke a request to access their profile page
2) Create a gravater link using the gravater service, avatars associated with users(models)
3) insert avatar images into user profiles so when the user goes on their profile they can view their avatar (user)
4) avatar is also implemented to the posts*
5) alter index page so that posts also show with avatars, this could be the same as profile but is kept seperate so if the layout is changed it does not need to be changed in both pages (post)
6) add extra information in profile pages
7) record the last time a user was seen added (routes/model)
8) Profile editor so that users are able to change their information and aboutme section
